# Tempo-Kleine-Fische

Our game revivals the scenery in Avanti mare where a river flows into the big sea! At one end of the river, a fishing boat sets off downstream towards the sea that waits at the end.
Halfway to the sea, four fish are playing in the water - but as soon as this boat starts moving, the fish will flee to the safety of the open water.

## Game Rules:
Players can choose to bet on either the fish or the fishermen, but the winners are determined by the dice rolls. In one round the player rolls the colored die. If the player rolls one of the two colors assigned to the boat, he removes one of the river segments, thereby moving the boat closer to the fish; If one of the fish colors is rolled, that fish moves one space closer to the sea. When the boat moves toward a fish, it catches that fish; when a fish reaches the sea, it escapes and cannot be caught. The game ends when all fish escape or are caught. 
* If the number of free fish is more than catch fish, fish wins. Otherwise, fishermen win.
* In the case that the number of free fish and catch fish are the same, two sides draw.
